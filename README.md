**An introductory guide for enthusiasts and students to learn how computers work and program their own**

## What is this book about?
This comprehensive guide offers a unique and immersive learning experience by combining Python programming with ARM architecture.
Starting with an introduction to computer architecture and the flow of data within a computer system, you’ll progress to building your own interpreter using Python. You’ll see how this foundation enables the simulation of computer operations and learn ways to enhance a simulator by adding new instructions and displaying improved results.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Master the core principles of computer architecture
* Understand the role of registers, memory, and data flow in computers
* Discover how to design and implement a computer simulator using Python
* Simulate and execute assembly language programs on the simulator
* Enhance the simulator using new instructions for improved output
* Analyze complex computer instructions for deeper architectural understanding
* Explore the ARM instruction set and data processing on the Raspberry Pi
* Develop proficiency in writing, assembling, and running ARM code on the Raspberry Pi

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
for i in range (0,6): # Repeat six times
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for university students studying computer science, particularly those enrolled in a computer architecture module. With its practical approach and succinct explanations, it is also suitable for hobbyists, enthusiasts, and self-learners seeking a deeper understanding of computer systems. The book assumes foundational knowledge of number bases, binary arithmetic, and Boolean logic concepts. While it primarily caters to the computer science field, this book is less geared toward electrical or electronics engineering.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-8 | Python | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |
| 9-12 | Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+/ Raspberry Pi 4 Model B | |
